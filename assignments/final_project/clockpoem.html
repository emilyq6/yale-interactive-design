        My Life in 24 Hours <br /> <br /> <br />

        Have you ever thought of your life as a measure of time and space, <br /> <br />

        Your relationships, your memories, all things that cannot be replaced. <br /> <br />

        When have you ever questioned the reason for 24 hours clocks <br /><br />

        Or why the cycle stays continuous and never stops? <br /><br />

        I asked these questions to myself as I reflected on my 16-year life,<br /><br />

        My relationships, my memories, events that caused me strife.<br /><br />

        I asked “what if our whole life was represented by just one single day,”<br /><br />

        Facing each memory, each photograph and never pushing away.<br /><br /> <br /><br />


        My creation is a representative piece,<br /><br />

        One that carries my life in with little words, to say the least.<br /><br />

        This clock measures my day in photographed memories,<br /><br />

        From birth to now, experiences that will never leave.<br /><br />

        Photos appear within this new 16 interval day,<br /><br />

        Chronologically accurate as each day portrays,<br /><br />

        The cycle of my life in the context of today.<br /><br />
