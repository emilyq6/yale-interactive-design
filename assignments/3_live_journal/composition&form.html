      <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
      <h3>Composition & Form</h3>
      <p>
        In my Graphic Design class, our first assignment was a compositon project where we could only use black rectangles to depict opposing
        adjectives and emotions on foam board. These adjectives consisted of young/old, angry/calm, beginning/end, early/late, predictable/
        spontaneous, fear/confidence, balance/instability, and masculine/feminine. We were told to choose 3 of the 8 pairs and then to get to
        work.
        <br />
        <br />
        We were given roughly 2 days to complete this project and below I have inserted my final compositions along with their explanations.
      </p>

    <h3>Feminine & Masculine</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="composition&form/feminine.JPG" width="189" height="252" style="float:left" />
      The idea of being a woman throughout time has seemingly meant to be contained. In early times women were kept inside households and never
      brought out into the "real world" but rather stayed within the places that were "safe."
      <br />
      <br />
      This idea is depicted by the black square in the center of the board. They stay in the area that they know, never wandering to the
      borders and edges of the board.
      <br />
      <br />
      Though, in the 21st century, women have separated further from these original stereotypes. They
      have broken out of this shell of confinement that defined them for so many years. This is represented by the black square, seeming
      to escape the initial black square it had come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="composition&form/masculine.JPG" width="189" height="252" style="float:left"/>
      Masculinity has always related towards an idea of strength. Men have been seen throughout society as a protector of those around them,
      as well as the provider of their homes and families. With this idea also came a feeling of restraint towards their emotions.
      <br />
      <br />
      The border created by black rectangles symbolizes a wall. The wall that stereotypically a man must be in order to truly be "a man"
      the rest of society. This wall protects those that are important to them, and also contains the emotions that have been "forbidden"
      from the rest of the world to see.
      <br />
      <br />
      Though, you can notice there's an opening in this wall. This opening symbolizes the defying of society's expectations that have
      emerged throughout the 21st century. Men are breaking through this stereotype to become more emotional and less harsh on their
      emotions as well as their actions.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to make a composition that looked almost like two puzzle pieces coming together to make a whole. The reason behind this being
      that men and women have their differences, but they need one another to be full and complete.
    </p>

    <h3>Young & Old</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="composition&form/young.JPG" width="189" height="252" style="float:right"/>
      The depiction of America's flag through these black rectangle is a reprensentation of America's beginnings as a young nation, new
      to the rest of the world. Young, pure, and organized it began as a place of freedom and equality for "all men."
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="composition&form/old.JPG" width="189" height="252" style="float:right"/>
      This version of America's flag is a representation of aging. As people and even a country ages, it becomes more and more corrupt
      those surrounding it as well as inner turmoil. The foundation gets shaken as the Constitution is altered again and again, furthering
      it from it's initial roots but still containing the core ideas it was found upon.
    </p>

    <h3>Calm & Angry</h3>
    <img src="composition&form/calm.JPG" width="189" height="252" style="float:left"/>
    <p>
      The idea of "calmness" has often been correlated with ocean waves. The feeling of sitting and watching the waves is extremely calming
      for many people which is why for the word "calm" I chose to create small ripples using my black rectangles. These were to represent
      small ocean waves and give a feeling of "relaxation" for the viewer.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="composition&form/angry.JPG" width="189" height="252"style="float:left"/>
    <p>
      To directly oppose those calm ocean waves, I created a tsunmai. This one big wave traveling in one direction and obliterating everything
      in it's path. Just how when we're angry, all of our other thoughts and emotions seem to dissapear until we only have our anger to think
      about.
