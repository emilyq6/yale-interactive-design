      As I walked through my elementary school library, I looked for new stories to begin reading. As I wandered throughout shelves of fairytales and Scholastic children stories I realized I was running out of time before my class
      would leave to head back to our teacher's classroom. I quickly grabbed a blue covered book from the shelf and checked it out hoping I could at least survive 10 minutes of reading time with this book I had grabbed.

      <br />
      Little did I know, this was my first step into a world I had never known before.
      <br />
      <br />
      The next couple years were a blur. After recieving the rest of the Percy Jackson series as my 5th grade promotion present, I read through all the books as quickly as possible. I treated each book like it was my child, taking
      the utmost of care for each one.

      As the series came to an end, I pondered on what my life would be after this series. How could I move on from such an important stage of my life. How could I say goodbye to all these characters that I've bonded with for years
      and years?
      <br />
      <br />
      Then suddenly I realized I didn't need to, Rick Riordan had written a second series continuing on with the story from the first five books. Relief washed over me as I realize goodbye would be a little farther away than I had
      originally thought.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Lost Hero, Son of Neptune, Mark of Athena, House of Hades, and Blood of Olympus all flew bly in a blur within the next couple years. The ups and downs of each book kept me on the edge of my seat for the next. I fell more
      and more in love with each character both old and new. These stories were a part of me and my life.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and I knew these characters wouldn't stay with me forever. The story of Percy Jackson has made an incredibly impact on my life and on who I am. I will forever be thankful of Rick
      Riordan and the day a random 5th grade teacher from Boston decided to write down his mythical stories that he made up for his ADHD diagnosed and Dyslexic son.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thanks for all the memories, they will always live on within me and millions of others around the world.
